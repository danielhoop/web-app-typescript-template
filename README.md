# Typescript template with pipeline for Javascript transpilation
This project contains a simple template to write a web app using Typescript.

For compatibility reasons, the [npm](https://github.com/npm) pipeline will transiple Typescript to Javascript (ES2017).  
The multi-step pipeline uses [Typescript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript) and [babel](https://github.com/babel/babel) for transpilation and [webpack](https://github.com/webpack) to bundle all necessary resources for the app.  
For styling, the project uses a generic [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap) template.

For more information on how to set up and use the pipeline, read the instructions in [SETUP.md](SETUP.md).
